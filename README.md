# pong-frontend

A simple frontend for a multiplayer version of pong built for a talk at [HalfStack On the Shore(ditch) 2022][hs] using Websockets, long-running lambdas (for game loops), and a heap of other tech. For the back-end project go to [this repo][bf]

Note: This is a rough and ready demo - do not copy and paste this and expect production quality code!
